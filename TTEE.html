	<p><b>Get Pikachu As Your Starter Pok&eacutemon:</b> As I've said another page, you do have the option to catch pikachu as your starter pok&eacutemon, rather
	than charmander, squirtle, or bulbasaur, the starters of <em>Generation One</em>. This can only be achieved at the very start of the game, as that is when you are
	presented with the starters. When the starters appear, you need to make sure that you definitely don't <a href="HTP.html#howtocatchpokemon">catch</a> one, 
	but instead keep walking in a certain direction for quite some time. Each time you travel far enough, the starters will disappear and then reappear right next to you. 
	If you do this four times, they will reappear, but this time pikachu will be joining the party instead. There isn't really any benefit for catching pikachu as your starter 
	except for adding it to your <a href="HTP.html#howtocatchpokemon">pok&eacutedex</a>, especially since it will be incredibly low CP, but hey, for all of you 
	pikachu fans, that's how you get him as your very first pok&eacutemon. </p></div>

	<div class="desc1"> Eeveelution Naming Trick </div>
	</div>
	</div>
	<p><b>Eeveelution Easter Egg:</b> Eevee is pok&eacutemon that has three <a href="HTP.html#evolvingpoweringup">evolutions</a> in <em>Generation One</em>, and many more in further Gens. It can either
	evolve into vaporeon, flareon, or jolteon, and all occur randomly. However, it has been discovered that if you name an eevee certain names, it will evolve into your
	chosen eeveelution. <em>Rainer</em> for vaporeon, <em>Pyro</em> for flareon, and <em>Sparky</em> for jolteon. This trick however can only be used once, so be wise, as once it has been done, 
	you will have a 1 in 3 chance to get it again, and as you progress, stronger eevees will appear, and may be of better use than the previously evolved weaker eevees.
	This trick can be incredibly useful as vaporeon is one of the strongest pok&eacutemon in the game, and will be desired by many, so make sure you don't waste
	your one and only name opportunity!</p></div>

	<p><b>How To Use Items Effectively:</b> There are several <a href="HTP.html#itemstheshop">items</a> that have huge potential in terms of player gain and smart 
	usage. <a href="HTP.html#pokeball">Pok&eacuteballs</a> need to be used sparingly, and make sure that time on your throws. This is because you really don't want to waste them due to bad throws. Also, try to make sure that they land inside
	the pok&eacutemon's catch circle, and also, if you have a lot of pok&eacuteballs, practice curveballs, as they give you extra XP and higher catch rates. When using
	an <a href="HTP.html#incense">incense</a>, it is better to be moving, especially in car, as you will receive 1 pok&eacutemon per minute if you are travelling at a speed of 200m per minue, compared
	to one every five minutes when stationary. Also, if you are in the middle of nowhere, with no pok&eacutemon around you for miles, incences will generally spawn 
	rarer pok&eacutemon. When using <a href="HTP.html#luremodule">lures</a>, don't just use one, try to find an area with many pok&eacutestops within very close proximity of each other. It is also
	better if you are in a group, and many people can put one down rather than you putting down three. Upon doing this, you will receive better pok&eacutemon spawns
	and it gives your lure more value by using it in conjuction with other lures. Don't overuse <a href="HTP.html#razzberry">razz berries</a> on every pok&eacutemon you come across, as they will run out. 
	Instead, save them for the really rare and strong pok&eacutemon, and use them once per throw. With <a href="HTP.html#potions">potions</a>, make sure you are not healing a pok&eacutemon that
	only requires 100HP with a hyper potion, as you've just wasted half of that potion. Measure out how much health a pok&eacutemon needs to be recovered and use
	specific types of potion accordingly. With <a href="HTP.html#egg3">three-use egg incubators</a>, make sure to use them only for 5 and 10km eggs, leaving the 2km eggs for the <a href="HTP.html#egg">infinity incubator</a>. 
	By doing so, you get more out of your incubators as they will technically last longer. This is because one 10km egg is worth five 2km eggs, and with them in your 
	infinity incubator, you can get through more eggs for the same amount of distance. </p></div>

	<p><b>How To Gain XP/Level Up Fast:</b> There are several effective methods that can be used to gain XP quickly, which in turn, will make you level up fast. As 
	mentioned in how to use items effectively, you will gain tonnes of XP from <em>nice</em>, <em>great</em>, <em>excellent</em>, and curveball throws. One
	of the main XP gaining items, however, is the <a href="HTP.html#luckyegg">lucky egg</a>. What we'll be explaining here is how to use the item effectively, and thus gain you tonnes of XP. Of course,
	catching pok&eacutemon, taking down <a href="HTP.html#gyms">gyms</a>, evolving, spinning pok&eacutestops, and hatching eggs all give you XP, but sometimes, that isn't enough. Lucky 
	eggs are best used in numerous situations. In areas full of pok&eacutemon spawn, a lucky egg is sure to grant you tonnes of XP, as you'll be receiving double
	for every pok&eacutemon, and <em>nice</em>, <em>great</em>, <em>excellent</em>, and curveball throws will also be doubled. If you have multiple incubators
	running, and know multiple eggs are about to hatch, put a lucky egg on, as you'll be receiving twice as much XP per hatch, and they already give plenty of experience
	points. New pok&eacutemon added to the pok&eacutedex give you 500XP, so if you know your going to add one, activate a lucky egg, and take in that 1000XP for
	that new pok&eacutemon. Having a lucky egg on often while performing these methods will definitely get you far, but the ultimate XP gainer, is the lucky egg
	evolution spree. Once you have atleast 80 pok&eacutemon evolutions saved up, activate a lucky egg, and do them all. This will surely get you atleast 100k XP, in just 
	30 minutes, especially if you're receiving new pok&eacutemon to the pok&eacutedex along the way. If you actively have evolution sprees, the levels are certain
	to fly right by, and before you know it, you'll be level 40.</p></div>

	<div class="desc1"> Powering Up A Pok&eacutemon </div>
	</div>
	</div>
	<p><b>When To Power Up & Evolve:</b> Ok so, you know how to almost everything in the game so far, but there is still one common pressing question that needs to  
	be answered, when should I <a href="HTP.html#evolvingpoweringup">power up</a> and <a href="HTP.html#evolvingpoweringup">evolve</a>? First, let's start with evolving. You want to make sure that the pok&eacutemon you're evolving is the strongest you
	have, as IVs won't really matter until months from now. Once it has evolved, check its moveset. If it has what's desirable, you know you have a good pok&eacutemon. 
	It is ok to evolve at any stage in the game, as you will gather enough candies to evolve another, higher CP pok&eacutemon when you're higher level later on. The only
	reason you'd want to hold back is because none of your current ones are strong, the pok&eacutemon is extremely rare and you don't want to waste the candies on a 
	low CP pok&eacutemon, or you're saving up for the evolution spree. Save your stardust. Once you're atleast level 25 and have pok&eacutemon that are high CP
	with decent IVs and the best movesets, that is when you unload all of your saved up stardust, making them so much stronger. Don't make the mistake of powering a 
	pok&eacutemon up only to find a stronger version in the wild or from an evolution, as it will frustate you beyond imagining. </p></div>
<div id="trivia">

	80%.</li>
	<li><b>Pok&eacutemon Nests & Migrations</b> There are certain places known as <em>pok&eacutemon nests</em> which are areas where many of the same
	pok&eacutemon species spawn. These nests change every month to a pok&eacutemon one spot above or below the current pok&eacutemon on the pok&eacutedex.</li>
	<li><b>Megapok&eacutestop</b> If you spin 10 different consecutive pok&eacutestops within 45 minutes, you get a Megapok&eacutestop, which gives atleast six items
	and double XP.</li>
	<li><b>Legendaries & Ditto</b> The legendary pok&eacutemon of Generation One are in the game's code, but have not been released yet. Ditto, is an easter egg in the
