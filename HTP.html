	<h1> How To Play Pok&eacutemon GO </h1>
	<p> <b> Introduction: </b> Before you can start to play, there are several factors that need to be addressed. Of course, you are going to need to have a somewhat 
	up-to-date smartphone, with appropriate GPS, camera, and gyroscopic specs. Upon downloading the game from either the App Store or Google Play Store, you are
	required to login with either a google account, or Trainer's Club Account. From there, you are presented with Professor Willow, your early game guide. He explains
	the Pok&eacutemon World before you are asked to <em> customise</em> your own character. You can choose either male or female, and then a wide variety of 
	clothes and hairstyles in different colours. Once you're set, the scene changes to the game's GPS like view, and you are instructed to 
	<a href="#howtocatchpokemon"> catch a pokemon</a>, with only the starters, or <a href="TTEE.html#getpikachuasstarter"> pikachu</a>, of the <em> First Generation</em>
	available. Right after that, you will be asked to choose a nickname, and then the Professor will explain what <a href="#itemstheshop"> pok&eacutestops</a> and 
	<a href="#itemstheshop"> items</a> are before wishing you farewell into the world of Pok&eacutemon.</p> </div>

	</div>
	<p><b>Differences & Similarities:</b> Now, just like the DS based pok&eacutemon games, you will be catching, battling, leveling up, and trading pok&eacutemon, 
	but there are many differences in this new version that are quite interesting. Firstly, you actually need to be mobile in order to do something, unlike in the DS games
	where you would be relaxed	somewhere at home. The layout is completely different, with <a href="#gyms"> gyms</a>, pok&eacutemon <a href="#battling">
	movesets</a>, level representations, <a href="#evolvingpoweringup"> evolutions</a>, and items all changed. There is a menu 
	screen in the middle which displays your pok&eacutemon, items, settings, <a href= "#howtocatchpokemon2">pokedex</a>, and the <a href="#theshop"> shop</a>.
	On the pok&eacutemon section of the menu, your caught pok&eacutemon can be sorted in various different ways, and your eggs are all displayed on a separate 
	page accessed when you swipe to the left. The <a href= "#thetrackingsystem"> tracking system</a> is located in the bottom right, and your 
	<a href="#evolvingpoweringup">trainer stats</a> are on found on the left. As mentioned, the only pok&eacutemon available in Pok&eacutemon GO are from 
	Generation 1, with six more to come later. There aren't pok&eacutecenters or pok&eacuteshops, so items are gained through
	pok&eacutestops, or spending real money in the shop. Levels of Pok&eacutemon aren't told in Pok&eacutemon GO, they are instead 
	represented with CP (Combat Power), a statistical formula that results in number number between 10 and 4199, but they still do a good enough job to show what's
	good and what isn't. The stats of each pok&eacutemon species has been brought to Pok&eacutemon GO the same, with IVs and EVs also present. IVs
	can be found with a recently added <em>appraisal system</em>, where your <a href="#teamsgymsbattling">team</a> leaders assess your pok&eacutemon, with different
	phrases meaning different things. To see each and everyone of them means, click <a href="images.html#appraisal">here</a>. Evolving, and training 
	pok&eacutemon up also work differently in this game, which is explained below.<p> </div>

	<div class="desc1"> Pok&eacutemon Evolution </div>
	</div>
	</div>
	<p><b>Evolving & Powering Up:</b> Pok&eacutemon are evolved with candies, which are gained through catching pok&eacutemon of 
	the same species, and are "powered up" with stardust, also obtained through catching pok&eacutemon. Depending on the pok&eacutemon's level, it will have 
	different quantities required for powering up. The stardust levels range from 200 to 10000, and the candies from 1 to 4. A pok&eacutemon gains a certain + 
	amount to its CP for each powering up depending on the species, stage, and stats. Pok&eacutemon with 3 stage evolutions require 25 candies for the first 
	evolution, and then 100 for the final evolution. Pok&eacutemon with 2 stage evolutions require 50 candies to evolve. Pok&eacutemon with different outcomes, 
	such as eevee, generally have a 25 candie cost. Magikarp, is an exception, requiring an astonishing 400 candies to evolve. When evolved, a pok&eacutemon's CP 
	will certainly increase, and are somewhat predictable as they have certain multipliers. Pok&eacutemon can be nicknamed into anything, and favourited (shown with 
	a yellow star next to them). As a trainer, you have levels, and are rewarded with items for each level. They are measured in experience points, which are gained in 
	various ways. So far, level 40 is the highest level you can possibly be, and each time you climb higher up the level ladder, rarer and more stronger pok&eacutemon 
	start to appear, and higher class <a href="#itemstheshop">items</a> begin to unlock as well. </p> </div>

	<h1> How To Catch Pok&eacutemon </h1>
	<p><b>How To Catch Pok&eacutemon:</b> The game tells you how to catch a pok&eacutemon in beginning, but we're here to give you a more, indepth description.
	First, you need a pok&eacutemon to be on your screen. Next, you need to tap on the pok&eacutemon and wait as the game engages you. You can't battle wild 
	pok&eacutemon in Pok&eacutemon GO like in the DS games, so all you do it catch them. When engaged, you have the choice to either try catch it in AR (augmented
	reality) mode, or catch in the game's inbuilt scenic background view. A <a href="#pokeball">pok&eacuteball</a> should appear in the bottom of your device, 
	bouncing up and down eagerly as it awaits to be thrown at the wild pok&eacutemon. To throw, just drag the ball up the screenof the phone as straight as you can
	with any prefered finger, releasing near the midpoint of your device. This should send the ball flying towards the pok&eacutemon. Upon successfully hitting it, the 
	pok&eacutemon will become sucked into the ball, and it will begin to wobble. In order for the pok&eacutemon to be caught, the ball needs to wobble three 
	consecutive times, and stars will burst out when this occurs. Poke&eacutemon may pop out during the first or second rolls, or may hit away or evade oncoming 
	balls. Annoyingly, you are able to miss throws if not accurate, and some rarer pok&eacutemon are further back, making it harder to reach them, wasting 
	pok&eacuteballs (Niantic claims it's not marketing tactic to make you but more pok&eacuteballs). </p> </div>

	<div class="desc1"> Catching A Pok&eacutemon </div>
	</div>
	</div>
	<p><b>More On Catching:</b> When catching a pok&eacutemon, you have special items that unlock as you progress available to you that should help you catch 
	them, which will be explained in the items section. The rarity of pok&eacutemon can be indicated with different colours of the ring	in which the pok&eacuteball 
	should be thrown. It starts green, then transitions to yellow, next orange, red, and then incredibly dark red. The darker they are, they harder they are going to be to 
	catch. When you have successfully caught a pok&eacutemon, it will register to your pok&eacutedex (pok&eacutemon database) if not caught already, and you will 
	be presented with a screen demonstrating XP gain and confirming that it has been caught. You receive 100 XP for each pok&eacutemon, 500 XP for every new
	pok&eacutemon added to the pok&eacutedex, and either 10, 50, or 100 XP for throwing <em> nice</em>, <em>great</em>, or <em>excellent</em> throws, which
	occur when the ball lands inside different sized proportions of the pok&eacutemon's circle. Experienced players will also throw <em> curveballs</em> (the ball spins
	away from the screen and the back into the pok&eacutemon, generally harder to do) for extra XP and higher catch rates. </p></div>

	</div>
	<p><b>Catch Em' All:</b> Pok&eacutemon that have not been registered to be the pok&eacutedex will appear as silhouettes on the tracking system, pok&eacutemon that have been seen but
	not caught will appear as silhouettes on the pok&eacutedex and tracking system, and pok&eacutemon that have been caught will appear as their fully coloured
	icons on the tracker, and all information filled out on the pok&eacutedex. For every pok&eacutemon caught, you receive 100 stardust and 3 of their specific species 
	candy. Unwanted pok&eacutemon	can	be transferred to Professeur Willow for an extra candy, and will be unable to get back, so don't accidentally transfer your 
	best one! You can favourite your pok&eacutemon by tapping the star icon in the top-right corner. This is can be because its your <em> favourite</em>, there is 
	something significant about it, or you just want to make sure you don't accidentally transfer it, as you can't transfer a favourited pok&eacutemon. Eggs are also 
	present in the game, ranging from 2km, to 5km, to 10km walking distances to hatch. The three different types of eggs all have set pok&eacutemon you can receive
	from them, with the chart 	<a href="images.html#eggchart">here</a>, and give more candies and stardust than catching a normal pok&eacutemon would.</p> </div>

	<div class="desc1"> Sightings & Nearby </div>
	</div>
	</div>
	<p><b>The Tracking System (Finding Them):</b> There is an inbuilt feature in the game, currently known as your "sightings", which undeniably has caused a lot of 
	controversy and tension within the game, that helps players locate pok&eacutemon. It has been changed a great deal since its initial release, and Niantic is still 
	working on improving it, with a recent system that looks to be spectacular already out in a select few places. For those of us stuck with the pretty average version, 
	here is how to properly use the boring version of the tracking system. Before you can catch a pok&eacutemon, it needs to be on your sighting's list. To find it, you 
	need to walk exactly straight in any direction, until it either disappears or appears. If you walk forwards and it doesn't show up, and rather falls off the radar, mark
	that as point A, and walk in the other direction until it disappears again (unless of course it does appear), marking that as point B. From here, you need to walk back
	to directly in the middle of the two points and head either left or right, perpendicular to the line you just walked along. If it doesn't appear on the left, then it has to 
	appear on the	right. This has been proven mathetically and if you try, you will see that it works. And that, is how you find a pok&eacutemon at the moment. For
	those of you lucky enough to have the special version, here is how that works too. You have a seperate section for "sightings" and for "nearby". Pok&eacutemon 
	on the nearby will appear with an image of a pok&eacutestop next to them, and when tapped, the map will zoom out and show you where that pok&eacutestop is,
	indicating it with a purply-pink icon. Once you get there, that pok&eacutemon should be there. This version if obviously far better, as it less time wasting and 
	definitely more fun, but it takes time to input into the rest of the world, so many of us will be waiting for a long time.</p> </div>

	</div>
	<p><b>Items:</b> Items definitely play a key role in the structure of the game. There are many items from the original DS games that we have, like the 
	<a href="#pokeball">pok&eacuteball</a> and <a href="#potions">potions</a>, but there are so many more that we don't. However, Pok&eacutemon GO brings its 
	own signature items, such as the <a href="#luremodule">lure 
	module</a>, which helps balance it out. According to people that have looked into the code, there are still many more special Pok&eacutemon GO exclusive items
	coming in future updates. Here, we will give an in-game description of the items, as well as our own so that you get best of both world's, and fully understand how
	they work. To see how to use them to their maximum potential, click <a href="TTEE.html#howtouseitemseffectively">here</a>. Before we get into the items, however
	it would be best if you know how to acquire these items. As you level up, you are awarded and unlock new items. You can buy various items from <a href="#theshop">
	the shop</a>,	which is explained below, but most people gain majority of their items from pok&eacutestops. A pok&eacutestop is some sort of monumental figure, 
	e.g. a statue, that when spun, gives out items. Only some specific items can be gained from a pok&eacutestop, with others being either bought from the shop or 
	gained as level up awards. To see the full chart of rewards for leveling up, click <a href="images.html#levelrewardchart"> here</a>. To see every item, click 
	<a href="images.html#items">here</a>.<p>
<hr>
<ul>
	<li id="pokeball"><b>Pok&eacuteballs:</b> "A device for catching wild Pok&eacutemon. It's throw like a ball at a Pok&eacutemon, comfortably encapsulating its
	target." A pok&eacuteball is basically the standard item that everyone starts with. You are given 50 at the beginning, and they are the most common item found 
	at pok&eacutestops. They supposedly have the lowest catch rate out of all of the obtainable balls, and have the lowest worth.</li>
	<li><b>Greatballs:</b> "A good, high-performance Pok&eacute Ball that provides a higher catch rate than a standard Pok&eacute Ball." A Greatball is rarer to find 
	from pok&eacutestops and in when used in comparison to a Pok&eacuteball, the pok&eacutemon's colour appears to be less dark, proving its higher catch rate.</li>
	<li><b>Ultraballs:</b> "An ultra-high performance Pok&eacute Ball that provides a higher catch rate than a Great Ball." Ultraballs are incredibly hard to from 
	pok&eacutestops, but provide massively good odds when catching pok&eacutemon. However, use them sparingly, for they won't come back.</li>
	<li id="potions"><b>Potion:</b> "A spray-type medicine for treating wounds. It restores the HP of one Pok&eacutemon by 20 points." Potions are abundant from 
	pok&eacutestops, almost as common as pok&eacuteballs. They are great early game when your pok&eacutemon have low maximum health, but can take forever
	to heal stronger pok&eacutemon.</li>
    <li><b>Super Potion:</b> "A spray-type medicine for treating wounds. It restores the HP of one Pok&eacutemon by 50 points." Slightly rarer than potions, but 
	quicker to health injured pok&eacutemon with.</li>
	<li><b>Hyper Potion:</b> "A spray-type medicine for treating wounds. It restores the HP of one Pok&eacutemon by 20s points." Despite they ability, they are 
	not as rare as you think, and these sweet potions will heal majority of your pok&eacutemon instantly.</li>
	<li><b>Max Potion:</B> "A spray-type medicine for treating wounds. It will completely restore the max HP of a single Pok&eacutemon." Maxes are very hard to 
	find from pok&eacutestops, but will heal anything without a question. Pretty awesome if you ask me.</li>
	<li><b>Revive:</b> "A medicine that can revive fainted Pok&eacutemon. It also restores half of the Pok&eacutemon's max HP." Revives are also quite common 
	from pok&eacutestops and are nice and nifty for battle. They bring your fainted pok&eacutemon back to life, and even give some extra HP.</li>
	<li><b>Max Revive:</b> "A medicine that can revive fainted Pok&eacutemon. It also fully restores a fainted Pok&eacutemon's maximum HP." They are stupidly 
	hard to find from pok&eacutestops, but Max Revives are great when you don't have the time heal pok&eacutemon, and just wanna battle!</li>
	<li id="razzberry"><b>Razz Berry:</b> "Feed this to a Pok&eacutemon to make it easier to catch." Somewhat common from pok&eacutestops, pok&eacutemon seem to love 
	this type of berry, and giving it them will make them all soft and mushy, ready to be caught. You can only use one berry per successful throw.</li>
	<li id="luckyegg"><b>Lucky Egg:</b> "A Luck Egg that's filled with happiness! Earns double XP for 30 minutes." Lucky Eggs can only be obtained through the shop or level 
	rewards, and are great for leveling up fast in the early stages, or grinding through those higher levels.</li>
	<li id="incense"><b>Incense:</b> "Incense with a mysterious fragrance that lures wild Pok&eacutemon to your location for 30 minutes." Also only obtained through the shop 
	or level rewards, incenses make you a pok&eacutemon magnet, spawning a pok&eacutemon every 5 minutes when stationary, or every 1 minute if moving over
	200 meters per minute. Perfect for when in the car or at home, too lazy to get out. </li>
	<li id="luremodule"><b>Lure Module:</b> "A module that attracts Pok&eacutemon to a Pok&eacuteStop for 30 min. The effect benefits other people nearby." 
	Once again, they are only obtained through the shop or level rewards, but if you place one of these badboys down, everyone will see you as a hero. A lured 
	pok&eacutestop is indicated with pink petals floating around it, it's impossible to miss.</li>
	<li id="egg"><b>Egg Incubator &infin; :</b> "A device that incubates an Egg as you walk until it is ready to hatch. Unlimited use!" The infinity sign indicates its infinite usage, 
	and you have this helpful at the very start of the game, and stays with you until the end. only one, however, is agonising.</li>
	<li id="egg3"><b>Egg Incubator:</b> "A device that incubates an Egg as you walk until it is ready to hatch. Breaks after three uses." These incubators can be received as 
	leveling up rewards and will be craved by many as they cringe when their kilometres aren't going towards every egg.</li>
	<li><b> Camera:</b> "When you encounter Pok&eacutemon in the wild, you can use your camera to photograph them." The camera allows you to take photos
	of any pok&eacutemon you encounter in the wild, which apparently is for the people who used to play an old game called Pok&eacutemon Snap. Some people 
	also believe that it may hold the key to finding Ditto...</li>

	</div>
	</div>
	<p><b>The Shop:</b> The shop is just like what you find in any game consisting of in-app purchases. You have another currency known as <em> Pok&eacutecoins
	</em> which are what us used to buy specific shop items. They come in packs of 100, 550, 1200, 2500, 5200, and 14500, and their prices Aus are $1.49, $7.99,
	$14.99, $30.99, $62.99, and $159.99. Coins be also be obtained through holding <a href="#gyms"> gyms</a>, as a gym defender's bonus. With these coins, you can 
	<em>exchange</em> them for either packs of 20, 100, or 200 Pok&eacuteballs, at prices of 100, 460, and 800 pok&eacutecoins. You can but incenses at one for 80,
	8 for 500, and 25 for 1250. Lucky Eggs come in the same batches as incenses, but lure modules, due to their multiple person benefit are a bit more expensive. One module
	costs 100 coins, and 8 cost 680. A 3-use incubator costs an expensive 150. Each trainer has a set amount of bag storage space and pok&eacutemon storage space,
	350 items worth in the bag, and 250 for pok&eacutemon. You can buy upgrades for both at 200 coins per 50 space increase, maxing out at 1000 total space. 
	Surprisingly, there are many items that can't buy from the store, like greatballs or ultraballs, or potions, or stardust, or candies. If they had them available, I'm
	sure so many people would happily invest in them, filling up on the stardust needed for <a href="#evolvingpoweringup">powering up</a> their best 
	pok&eacutemon.</p> </div>

	<p><b>Teams:</b> Upon reaching level 5, the Professeur asks you to select a team when you tap on a gym. Prior to that, tapping on gym will only present you the 
	Professeur telling you that you aren't strong enough to battle. You have three teams to choose from, Instinct, which is yellow, Mystic, which is blue and Valor, 
	which is red. It is not compulsory to choose a team, but it would be silly not to as you can't battle, take gyms, or collect defender's bonus. Once you pick a team,
	there is no way to change it, so choose wisely. If you don't know what team to choose, the best course of action to take would be to be on the same team as your 
	friends, or its your favourite colour. It is also rumoured that your team determines what Legendary Pok&eacutemon you receive, Zapdos for Instinct, Articuno for 
	Mystic, and Moltres for Valor, and that might also be a reason for choosing a team. When presented with choosing a team, each of the Team Leaders, Spark of 
	Instinct, Blanche of Mystic, and Candela or Valor, each say a couple of things trying to persuade you to join. </p></div>
<div id="teams">
	<p> Spark says "Hey! The name's Spark-the leader of the
	Team Instinct. Pok&eacutemon are creatures with excellent intuition. I bet they secret to their intuition is related to how they're hatched. Come on and join my team!
	You never lose when you trust your instincts!", Blanche says "I am Blanche, leader of Team Mystic. The wisdon of Pok&eacutemon is immeasurably deep. I am 
	researching why it is that they evolve. My team? With out calm analysis of every situation, we can't lose!", and Candela says "I'm Candela-Team Valor's leader!
	Pok&eacutemon are stronger than humans, and they're warmhearted, too! I'm researching ways to enhance Pok&eacutemon's natural power in the pursuit of 
	true strength. There's no doubt that the Pok&eacutemon our team have trained are the strongest in battle! Are you ready?". Then, you tap on the team you want,
	and you're in, becoming a representative and member of that team. Team statistics show that 43% of players chose Team Mystic, 32% chose Team Valor, and 25%
	chose Team Instinct, however this was on 15th of July, and these numbers are subject to change. Team Instinct is said to be the underdog team, having the least
	amount of players and there have been many memes created around Spark, the leader, and the small figure of Instinct members. Valor, has been made to be the
	aggressive team, with many memes created demonstrating violence, and Mystic, has managed to stay generally untouched. There is fierce competion between team
	members, and many people are being defined by the team they have chosen. </p></div>

	<p><b>Gyms:</b> Gyms are pok&eacutemon battling centers where players of every team compete and work with each other to take down, hold, and level up 
	gyms. Gyms that are taken by Team Instinct are yellow, gyms taken by Mystic are blue, and Valor gyms are red. Gyms without a team (which is incredibly rare
	and probably only for a few seconds) are white. In order to make a gym your's, you need to battle the defending pok&eacutemon, which have been placed by
	other people from other teams, and lower the gym's <em>prestige</em> all the way down to 0. Upon taking a gym, it turns white, and changes to your team's 
	colour when you place your pok&eacutemon in. Each player can only place one pok&eacutemon at a time, and all defending pok&eacutemon must come from the 
	same team. A gym's <em>prestige</em> determines how many pok&eacutemon you can put in their, which is the gym's <em>tiers</em>, and can only be raised
	by people from the same team training it up. Initially, once you take a gym three players can put their pok&eacutemon in before you need to train it up. This is 
	because placing a pok&eacutemon in a gym gives it 2000 points, and tiers 1, 2, 3 only require 2000 each. To get to tier 4, you need 8000 overall, then 12000,
	16000, 20000, 30000, 40000, and then 50000 for the maximum tier of 10. A gym this high level would be incredibly strong but require hours of leveling up.</p></div>

	<div id="gyms2">
	<p>When training a gym up, you can only use one pok&eacutemon, which makes it incredible hard to level up fast, as the more you beat, the quicker the prestige goes up.
	Taking a gym down, however, is a lot quicker. This is because you can have up to six pok&eacutemon to use, and many other players battling with you well. When
	this occurs, you can see your comrade's pok&eacutemon fighting on the other side of the screen, and all damage they do to the defending pok&eacutemon, tranfers
	onto your screen, and vice versa. Sure, when training a gym up multiple people can level it up with you, but you can't do it linked like in battling, and it's still incredibly
	slow. With this system, it so much easier to take a gym down than level it up, and with so many players actively playing, it always going to be super hard to keep a gym.
	However, when you do have a gym, you can collect something known as <em>Defender's Bonus</em>. To collect this bonus of 10 Pok&eacutecoins and 500 Stardust,
	you need to be currently owning a gym, and it is accessed in the shop as an icon with a shield on it at the top of the screen. Depending on how gyms you have, it will 
	display a different number in accordance. The more you own, the more you receive. However, this bonus resets every 21 hours, and once you've cashed in, it doesn't
	matter if you've taken another gym because you won't be able to get that bonus until 21 hours later, so steal as many gyms as you can before you claim the reward!<p></div>

	<p><b>Battling:</b> So, as you've heard before, gyms are the only place to battle, but how exactly do you battle, and what are the best ways to it? Well, to begin with,
	you want to make sure that you're using pok&eacutemon that have type advantages over defending pok&eacutemon, or atleast, their moves are. The see the type 
	chart, click here. You also want to make sure that you are using your strongest pok&eacutemon of that type advantage, and using all six available spots appropriately.
	You are allowed to view defending pok&eacutemon before you battle, so you can plan what you want to use against what, and you have the ability to switch 
	pok&eacutemon during battle, so you always have that type advantage upperhand. Movesets, and evidently battles, work differently in Pok&eacutemon GO. A 
	pok&eacutemon has a primary, fast attack that deals small damage but instantly, and a secondary charge attack, which is incredibly powerful, but takes time to 
	charge and cast. Every pok&eacutemon has six possible combinations of movesets, with some being better than others, but as now, are chosen randomly. So you 
	may have an incredibly strong pok&eacutemon that is a let down because of its moveset. </p></div>
	
<div id="battling2">
	<p>Also STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage is present, so same type moves are better. Now, when you've taken everything into account and have evaluated 
	the opposition appropriately, it's time to press the <em>battle</em> button. You will be taken to the battle arena with your first pok&eacutemon in the lineup facing
	the defending	pok&eacutemon at tier 1. To use your pok&eacutemon's fast attack, jsut tap on the screen like crazy. As you do this, you should see a blue meter
	above the	pok&eacutemon gradually fill up. This is the charge move, and some can be 1 huge bar or many smaller bars. Once full, hold down on the screen to 
	activate it, and then you will need to use your fast attack to fill it up again. You can also dodge attacks by swiping to either	the left or the right. A bright light will 
	appear on screen indicating when to dodge, so don't use the defending pok&eacutemon's animation as your key. If you make a successful dodge, only 25% of the
	intended damage will be taken. After a battle, fainted pok&eacutemon will need to be revived, and injured pok&eacutemon will need to be healed. </p></div>
