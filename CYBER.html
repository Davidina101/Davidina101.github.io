	</div>
	</div>
	<p><b>Getting Banned:</b> It is possible to get your account banned in various types of ways using different types of methods, so be careful! You can either be
	soft-banned, or permabanned. A soft-ban is where you won't be able to play for a certain amount of time, or every pok&eacutemon you come across instantly runs
	and <a href="HTP.html#itemstheshop">pok&eacutestops</a> don't give items (can be fixed by spinning a pok&eacutestop 40 times). A perma-ban, as implied by the name, is where a player's account
	becomes permanently banned, and they will they not be able to play on that account again. People who have this happen to them will receive an email from
	<a href="WIPG.html#thedevelopers">Niantic</a> confirming the ban, but they appeal to have their account restored. No you're probably thinking, how would somebody get banned? Well, being a popular,
	online, GPS, game, there are some clever people who have found ways to manipulate the GPS and play wherever they want around the world. They also
	have smart programs known as <em>bots</em>, which play the game for them. By doing so, players have the unfair advantage to be anywhere they want, and can
	teleport to rare pok&eacutemon sightings. However, if players aren't careful enough, they may be spotted by Niantic and become perma-banned. Also, Niantic has
	an anti-teleport system where anyone found teleporting will soft-banned. We won't disclose what these websites are and how to get these hacks, but make sure you
	don't go searching them up yourself. There are also risks for players who use third-party websites to check their pok&eacutemon's
	statistics to see which ones are the best. In order to this, players need to log in with their accounts into that third-party website, which according to Niantic, is 
	against their terms of service and will get you banned. If you make sure not to do any of these silly things, you're account will surely stay fine.

	<p><b>Online Location Risks:</b> Pok&eacutemon GO is an online game that revolves around your phone's GPS, and as we've just mentioned, there are people that have
	manipulated the game's GPS, and may even have the skills to view an individual person's position via the signals resonated from their Pok&eacutemon GO. With that being
	said, that isn't really too of a worry as there hundreds of millions of players online everyday and there wouldn't be any reason for someone to target you specifically, but we 
	would advise that you don't play at night, unless in a group or a very popular area, and even in the daytime, don't play alone. You really shouldn't be entering dark alleyways
	either, even more so when you're alone. It's always fun to play with a friend. Other than 
	that, enjoy!</p></div>

	</div>
	</div>
	<p><b>Dangerous Fake Websites:</b> If you have been to any comments section on any video related to Pok&eacutemon GO, you are bound to find countless 
	numbers of spam accounts trying to trick people into clicking their links, taking them to scammy websites asking for all the wrong details, as well as kindly giving
	your device or computer viruses. There will be people pretending to be famous youtubers by using their name and avatar/icon, and saying "Hey there to all my
	lovely fans! I have just discovered a really cool website that has helped me so much because of all the free Pok&eacutecoins! Just click the link and let it all come 
	through!", or there are multiple people/one person on many accounts, setting up their conversations, which tend to go like this: "Hey, can someone help me. I really
	need some Pok&eacutecoins :(" and then someone responds with: "Yes, I can help, I was in that situation a few days ago! But this website *insert virus here* has 
	given me 14 000 free Pok&eacutecoins! Have fun with them my friend :)", and then the first guy replies with: "OMG I can't thank you enough this has made me such 
	a better player than I ever was before! Now my Pok&eacutemon are so much stronger!". But in reality, we all know its fake. So guys as a general rule, do not click 
	any links you see in a video's comment section especially if they claim to have given someone pok&eacutecoins. As an individual, don't go searching up how get free
	pok&eacutecoins yourself either, because it will never work, and will only get you a nasty virus or in some very, deep, trouble. </p></div>

	</div>
	<p><b>Staying Safe & Aware Of Your Surroundings:</b> Pok&eacutemon GO is such a game that is hard not to immerse yourself in the <a href="HTP.html#thetrackingsystem">
	hunt</a>, <a href="HTP.html#howtocatchpokemon">catch</a>, or <a href="HTP.html#battling">battle</a>, rather
	than focus on what's going around you, but in reality, you really should. People not paying attention to what's going on have have some serious accidents and near
	misses. So many reports have been made about a person wandering onto a road while playing, tripping over someting, or stepping into or off something else. Even the
	game itself tells you to "Remember to be alert at all times.", and  "Stay aware of your surroundings". Also, don't play and drive. You're not only endangering yourself,
	but others on the road too. Upon opening the game, it will say, "Do not play Pok&eacutemon GO while driving.", and if you reach a fast enough speed that would occur
	when driving in a car, it asks you to confirm you are a passenger, and must not play if you are the driver. The game also has other messages, such as, "Do not trespass
	while playing Pok&eacutemon GO.", enforcing that you need to stay safe and aware of your surroundings. As much you want that rare pok&eacutemon that just to be
	over that fence, or in that area you're not supposed to go, don't risk it. With time, I'm sure you'll find another one, and it will probably be better too. 
	In order to achieve this, have a passenger work both phones
	as you drive, and if you are by yourself, just leave it. When on foot, always look up and around yourself every couple of seconds, taking your eyes of the screen for a 
	moment won't do you any harm, especially since pok&eacutemon will stay there. Don't play in areas where the terrain is quite rocky, slippery, mountainous, or dense
	with forestry, as you will trip, fall, slide, and walk into branches if not careful. When by the road, that is when you need to be the most careful. You should be looking ahead
	more than at your phone in that situation. It always best to play in parks and open areas, where its ok for you to wander without worrying about stepping in front of
	a bus. </p></div> </div>
